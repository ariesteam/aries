ARIES Installation Instructions
===============================

Thinklab dependency
-------------------

ARIES depends on a working Thinklab installation. If you have not yet
installed Thinklab, please download it from our Github repo here:
https://github.com/ariesteam/thinklab. Installation instructions for
Thinklab are included with that package.


PostgreSQL+PostGIS configuration
--------------------------------

In order to run ARIES models, Thinklab needs access to a local
database where it can store mappings between its modelling concepts
and the (possibly remote) datasources that will supply them with
values as needed.  We'll use PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extensions to
set this up.

1) Install PostgreSQL - http://www.postgresql.org/download/

2) Install the PostGIS extensions into PostgreSQL (if your installer
   didn't do that already) - http://postgis.refractions.net/download/

3) Start up your PostgreSQL server as a background service.  You might
   want to configure this to startup automatically whenever you login.

4) Run pgAdminIII to get a graphical PostgreSQL client running (or
   psql if you prefer to use a command line client).

5) Connect to your database server and create two new databases with
   these settings:

   Name: ariesdata
   Encoding: UTF8
   Template: template_postgis (you did remember to install PostGIS, right?)
   Owner: postgres (this is the default PostgreSQL administrator account)

   Name: <your_username>
   Encoding: UTF8
   Template: template_postgis
   Owner: postgres

7) Next open
   .thinklab/data/org.integratedmodelling.thinklab.sql/config/sql.properties
   in your user's home directory (it's just a text file), and add
   these lines to the end:

     thinklab.sql.user=postgres
     thinklab.sql.password=<your_database_administrator_password>
     thinklab.sql.host=localhost

   Save the file and exit.


Set your Environment Variables

|-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ARIES_SRC             | directory containing this INSTALL file                            |
| ARIES_HOME            | directory where you want to install the compiled version of ARIES |
| THINKLAB_PLUGINS      | plugins directory below ARIES_HOME                                |
| ARIES_GAZETTEERS_HOME | directory where gazetteer entries will be written                 |
| THINKLAB_ARCHIVE_DIR  | directory where GeoTIFF and PNG model outputs will be written     |

Build ARIES
-----------

On Windows, run the build_aries.bat script in the bin/ directory of
this repository.

On MacOS X or Linux/FreeBSD/PickYourNix, open up a command prompt and:

  $ cd $ARIES_SRC
  $ ant install


Run ARIES
---------

Just startup Thinklab (see the instructions in the INSTALL file of
that repository). Then when you reach the Thinklab prompt, you can
pull in the ARIES plugins like so:

  > pload aries

To update your ARIES PostgreSQL database, type this as well:

  > pload administration
  > run aries.initdb

If this runs to completion without errors, your database has been
populated and you can proceed to the next step. Note that you will
need an internet connection for this procedure to work as Thinklab
must connect to one or more remote geoservers to build up its
datasource mappings. You only need to rerun this command when there is
an update to the datasources available on these geoservers.

Next, you want to create and initialize your gazetteer database, so
that you can construct model contexts from WFS-accessible
Shapefiles. This only needs to be done once per ARIES installation. To
do this, type:

  > gazetteer create

You are now free to run models at your prompt with the model command,
like so:

  > model [-d | -v | -t | -o <filename.nc>] <model-name> <context-name>

For more information, type 'help model' at the Thinklab prompt.

To use ARIES' web-based user interface, you can run it on a local web
server like so:

  > pload explorer
  > http start aries

Then connect to the address that is printed as a response (usually
http://localhost:8060/aries.app) using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
or Safari. You can keep working at the Thinklab prompt while the
server is active. Just keep in mind that your machine may be taxed
excessively by running too many models simultaneously.

To shutdown the web-based user interface, type this:

  > http stop aries

Finally, to quit the Thinklab application, just type:

  > exit

That's it. Enjoy.
