* About this Software

clj-span is an implementation of the Service Path Attribution Networks
(Springer LNCS 2010 - Johnson et al.) framework for Ecosystem Service
Assessment.

Using clj-span, you can run a collection of parameterizable SPAN flow
simulation models (line-of-sight, proximity, carbon, and sediment
currently) and visualize their results as map outputs.

* Usage

To run clj-span, you will need:

1) Sun's JDK 1.6+
2) clj-span-standalone.jar (contains clojure and clojure-contrib)

Then simply place clj-span-standalone.jar on your classpath and fire
up your JVM as follows:

java -cp clj-span-standalone.jar clj_span.commandline \
     -source-layer       <filepath> \
     -sink-layer         <filepath> \
     -use-layer          <filepath> \
     -flow-layers        <filepath> \
     -source-threshold   <double>   \
     -sink-threshold     <double>   \
     -use-threshold      <double>   \
     -trans-threshold    <double>   \
     -rv-max-states      <integer>  \
     -downscaling-factor <number>   \
     -sink-type          <absolute|relative> \
     -use-type           <absolute|relative> \
     -benefit-type       <rival|non-rival>   \
     -flow-model         <line-of-sight|proximity|carbon|sediment>
