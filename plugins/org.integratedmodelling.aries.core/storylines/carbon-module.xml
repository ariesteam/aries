			Carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems is the net 
			removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere or the 
			avoidance of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from terrestrial 
			ecosystems into the atmosphere. The removal process includes 
			CO2 uptake from the atmosphere by all chlorophyllous plants, 
			through photosynthesis. This carbon (C) is stored as plant 
			biomass (in the trunks, branches, leaves and roots of the plants) 
			and organic matter in the soil (IPCC 2000). Terrestrial carbon 
			sequestration depends on a series of factors including climatic 
			conditions, vegetation structure and successional stage, and  
			land use practices.
