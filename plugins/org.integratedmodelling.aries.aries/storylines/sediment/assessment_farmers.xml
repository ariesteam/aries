  <title>Sediment regulation: Delivery of beneficial sediment to farmers or avoided undesirable sedimentation of farmland</title>
  <runninghead>Values resulting from sediment regulation by ecosystems in providing beneficial or detrimental sediment to floodplain farmland.</runninghead>
  <description>Values resulting from erosion prevention and natural
  sediment deposition by ecosystems, and accounting for the delivery
  of beneficial sediment or the prevention of detrimental
  sedimentation to farmland. Flow models are used to attribute
  beneficial or detrimental sources of sediment or "sinks" that
  promote sediment deposition in relation to their human
  beneficiaries.</description>

    <description>
      This model considers floodplain farmland as a potential beneficiary of sediment regulation.
      Depending on the crops and timing of sedimentation, this process can be beneficial, delivering
      new fertile sediment, or detrimental, causing crop damage.  These models map flows from sediment
      sources (areas of erosion), sinks (areas where deposition occurs), and beneficiary groups and
      link these via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of sediment.  To map farms
      susceptible to sedimentation, we simply intersect farmland with floodplain extents data.

      Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
      ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
      moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular
      portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that
      reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account
      the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of
      the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually
      useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source
      field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of
      sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.

      This map shows areas which, based on the flow pattern of sediment but when not
      accounting for sinks (i.e., depositional areas), provide sediment which reaches
      downstream users who either benefit from or are damaged by sediment delivery.

      services, potential use identifies areas where it is physically possible for a benefit to

      The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
      humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
      users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      In this case, the density of actual flows represents the downstream movement of sediment
      when accounting for sediment sinks (i.e., areas of deposition).

      This map shows areas which, based on the flow pattern of sediment and accounting
      for sinks (i.e., depositional areas), provide sediment to downstream users who
      either benefit from or are damaged by sediment delivery.

      The *actual sink map* shows the portion of the sinks that actually contribute
      to depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns. For provisioning
      services, such sinks are responsible for reducing the benefits compared to their
      possible value. For preventive services, such sinks provide the actual
      service because they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching users.

      This map shows depositional areas that undergo sedimentation, receiving
      upstream sediment and actively performing a sediment trapping function.

      The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
      service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for
      users located across the landscape.

      This map shows beneficiaries who receive beneficial or detrimental sedimentation when
      accounting for flow paths and sinks.

      The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a
      service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
      locations.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
      but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services,
      the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.

      This map shows areas which, based on the flow pattern of sediment, do not provide sediment
      to downstream users who either benefit from or are damaged by sediment delivery.

      The *blocked flow map* shows the flow paths that could have delivered the
      service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
      locations, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are selected from among
      all actual flows.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss in possible flow of
      beneficial services to the users, and their density is proportional to the value lost.
      For preventive services, the flow paths show the amount of the total flow that
      was prevented by natural features from causing damage.

      This map shows the flow of sediment that does not reach downstream beneficiaries
      (who benefit from either avoided detrimental sedimentation or beneficial sediment
      delivery).

      The *blocked source map* shows the part of the source map that had the possibility
      of reaching users given the location of the users and the flow dynamics, but
      was blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to value produced by the environment but lost before it reaches
      the users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.

      This map shows areas which, based on the deposition occurring sinks areas, do not
      provide sediment to downstream users who either benefit from or are damaged by
      sediment delivery.

      The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
      carrier based only on the source and the flow dynamics, but were not reached because
      of the action of sinks. For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      has not been accrued to users because of sinks; for preventive services, it shows
      actual value accrued by users thanks to sink configuration.

      For preventive services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
      value given the locations and quantity of users and natural sink features.

      This map shows beneficiaries who receive less detrimental sediment as a result of
      sink actions (sediment deposition).
