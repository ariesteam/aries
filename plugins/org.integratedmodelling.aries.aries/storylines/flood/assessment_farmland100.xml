  <description>Values resulting from flood regulation by ecosystems,
  including precipitation, ecosystems capable of providing
  infiltration or detention of flood waters, and farmland at risk of
  flooding (within the 100-year floodplain).  Flow models are used to
  connect beneficiaries to potential sources of flood water and
  quantify the action of natural "sinks" that slow, detain, or

    <description>
      This model considers farmland within the 100-year floodplain as
      a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Depending on their
      magnitude and timing, floods can cause severe crop damage.  These models map flows from flood sources
      (precipitation), sinks (areas whose topography, vegetation, and
      soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and
      beneficiary groups and link these via a flow model accounting
      for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map farms at risk
      of flooding, farmland and  floodplain extents data were simply intersected.

    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>Since the flood models currently run on an annual time scale, assessing overall flood regulation capacity
    rather than being event-based, the mean number of days of precipitation per year is used as a proxy for how
    often the soils are saturated.  If rainfall is relatively uncommon, the landscape may better be able to absorb
    floodwater than in wetter regions.  Mean days of precipitation per month data are also available.  To run
    flood models on an event-by-event basis, data or proxies for variables like soil saturation,
    precipitation, and snowmelt would be needed, which often have limited availability on a landscape scale.</p>

<h1>Role in models</h1>
<p>Maximum temperature determines the extent and rate of snowmelt and the presence of frozen soils.
This is used as an input to the probabilistic model estimating infiltration of floodwater, with no
infiltration occurring on frozen soils.  While this variable is of minimal relevance at an annual
time scale, the presence of frozen soils is highly important in the case of spring flood events where
snowmelt occurs and soils may still be frozen.  Temperature data at finer temporal scales will thus
be highly important in event-based flood models.</p>

    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>This is the output of a probabilistic model accounting for the influence of soil, vegetation,
    and their saturation on floodwater absorption and detention capacity.  Results are summed with
    "gray infrastructure" storage to give total flood regulation values, and then passed to the flow
    model to estimate actual flood mitigation given the location of sources of floodwater and
    beneficiaries at risk of flooding.</p>
    <h1>Representation</h1>
    <p>Data are in physical units of millimeters of floodwater absorbed or detained per year.
    As the output of the models is probabilistic, each point contains the probability distribution
    of the amount of floodwater regulated. The distribution can be visualized by clicking on the
    map; the mean value and the coefficient of variation are reported along with the probabilities.</p>

    <description>
      *Possible flow maps* show the path that the carrier of the 
      service would take if it was not intercepted by sinks.  
      As such it considers source and use models and shows the 
      maximum amount of flow. 

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to the maximum 
      potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum
      potential damage.

      This map shows the flow route of floodwater across the landscape in the absence of
      sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen if natural features
      did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows estimation of the actual
      value of those features.

      *Possible source maps*, generated through flow analysis, show which
      specific sources actually generate carriers that reach users,
      independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account
      use values and the carrier flow paths. Even in the absence of
      sinks, not all of a source quantity can actually reach users, 
      because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier moves 
      across the landscape. 

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to the source of 
      benefits that has the potential of being actually useful. For 
      preventive services, this corresponds to the sources that could 
      actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of 
      sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the
      users.

      This map shows runoff capable of harming people or damaging property when
      accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

      *Possible use maps* show the locations of users that can receive a
      benefit due to flow connections with a source of an ecosystem service carrier, but may
      or may not actually receive the carrier due to the action of
      sinks.  

      For provisioning services, potential use identifies areas where
      it is physically possible for a benefit to be received.  For 
      preventive services, potential use identifies areas that may be 
      damaged by a detrimental carrier if sinks do not prevent such
      damage.

      This map shows people and property receiving damage when accounting for sources
      of floodwater and its flow path but not accounting for the action of sinks that
      reduce potential damage from floodwater - in other words, the
      damage that would occur in the absence of flood-mitigating
      sinks.

      *Actual flow maps* show the flow paths that deliver actual services to
      beneficiaries. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
      users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      In this case, the density of actual flows shows floodwater that
      impacts people or property, after accounting for flood routing due to topography,
      stream networks, and natural and artificial features that detain, slow, or
      infiltrate floodwater.

      *Actual source maps* show sources that actually provide a
      service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics. 

      For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a 
      benefit that actually provides benefits to the users. For 
      preventive services, it shows where the actual damage came 
      from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier that 
      was neutralized by sinks are not shown.

      This map shows runoff that actually harms people or property when
      accounting for flow paths and sinks.

      *Actual sink maps* shows the sinks that actually contribute
      to depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns. 

      For provisioning services, such sinks reduce benefits to 
      users compared to their possible value. For preventive 
      services, such sinks provide the actual service because 
      they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching users.

      This map shows sinks that actively reduce floodwater, providing the benefit of
      reduced flood damage.

      *Actual use maps* show the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
      service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for
      users.

      This map shows actual damage received by people and property when accounting for
      sources of floodwater and their sinks and flow paths.

      *Blocked flow maps* show flow paths that could have delivered 
      an ecosystem service to humans based on the flow routes and 
      source and user locations, but did not because of the action 
      of sinks. These are selected from among all actual flows.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss of
      possible beneficial service flow to users, and their density 
      is proportional to the value lost. For preventive services, 
      the flow paths show the amount of the total flow that was 
      prevented by natural features from causing damage.

      This map shows flood flows that are absorbed by sinks prior to
      reaching people or property at risk of flooding.

      *Blocked source maps* show sources that had the possibility of 
      reaching users given the location of users and flow dynamics, but
      were blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. 

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to value produced by the 
      environment but lost before it could reach the users. For
      preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.

      This map shows the portion of the total runoff that is absorbed, detained, or
      slowed by the action of flood sinks.

      *Blocked use maps* show users that would have received a service
      carrier based on source and flow dynamics, but did not because
      of the action of sinks. 

      For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      were prevented by sinks from reaching users; for preventive 
      services, it shows actual value accrued by users from sinks 
      that blocked damaging flows. For preventive services, therefore, 
      this map is the ultimate quantification of value given the 
      locations and quantity of users and sink features.

      This map shows people or economically valuable assets who are 
      spared from flood damage due to the flood regulation provided by 
      sinks.
