    <description><![CDATA[
    <p>To better idenfify the distinct economic benefits and
    ecological processes related to disturbance regulation, we separately
    consider the protection of life and property from flooding along
    rivers, flooding in coastal zones, and prevention of landslides,
    mudslides, or avalanches. This module assembles all the storylines
    related to for flood regulationin the user-defined region.</p>

    <p>Ecological restoration focused on improving flood regulation
    can provide a range of co-beneficial ecosystem services, which can be
    simulated using scenarios in the ARIES flood model and other relevant
    ecosystem services models. For instance, reconnecting rivers to
    floodplains through levee setbacks can provide a wide range of
    economic benefits from ecosystem services. ARIES provides a missing
    spatial planning tool to explore tradeoffs between multiple ecosystem
    services associated with forest management and other flood mitigation
    projects.</p>

    <p>The ARIES flood models start by mapping sources of
    precipitation, which can cause floods, “sinks” that absorb, detain, or
    promote infiltration of floodwater, and the location of beneficiaries
    at risk of flooding that may receive flood mitigation benefits. Sink
    models incorporate vegetation and soils data that describes how well
    different areas can promote infiltration, as well as the location of
    engineered flood control infrastructure such as dams and detention
    basins. Flood flow models spatially link sources of floodwater,
    beneficial sinks, and beneficiaries in the landscape. These flow
    models account for the location and width of floodplains and the
    effects of levees, which both protect assets at risk behind levees and
    speed the flow of water downstream, potentially increasing downstream
    damage. Different beneficiary groups may be protected from flooding –
    crops, privately owned housing or other buildings, publicly owned
    infrastructure, and human life. GIS data showing riverine flood zones
    and maps of population, agriculture, and structures allows
    beneficiaries to be mapped.</p>

    <p>The ARIES flood regulation model currently operates using
    annual data for precipitation, runoff, infiltration, and
    evapotranspiration (measured in mm/yr). While modeling specific flood
    events) would be desirable, the data needed to populate these models
    at such time scales is rarely available. The current ARIES flood
    models can thus be used to explore general flood vulnerability, the
    beneficiaries of flood regulation, and the effects of flood mitigation
    alternatives (e.g., forest management, levee setbacks) on provision of
    flood regulation plus other co-benefit ecosystem services.</p>
