	of providing infiltration or detention of flood waters, and housing, infrastructure, or farmland at
	risk of flooding.  Flow models are used to connect beneficiaries to potential sources of flood water and

		This model considers floodplain farmland as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Depending on their magnitude and
		timing, floods can have devastating effects on crops.  These models map flows from flood sources (precipitation), sinks (areas
		whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and beneficiary groups and link these
		via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map farms at risk of flooding, we simply intersect farmland
		with floodplain extents data for either the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		This model considers protection of public infrastructure as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Public infrastructure (e.g.,
		transportation, energy, or water infrastructure) can be damaged by floodwater or the use of such infrastructure can be impaired 
		by inudation (e.g., roads being impassable due to flooding).  These models map flows from flood sources (precipitation), sinks (areas
		whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and beneficiary groups and link these
		via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map public infrastructure at risk of flooding, 
		we simply intersect roads, railways, or other infrastructure with data delimiting the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		This model considers protection of human life and housing as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  For people living in flood
		zones, floodwater can destroy housing and personal property and pose a risk to human lives.  These models map flows from flood sources 
		(precipitation), sinks (areas whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and 
		beneficiary groups and link these via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map housing at risk of 
		flooding, we simply housing data (where available) or NLCD developed land with data delimiting the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		<description>
		*Possible flow maps* represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
		if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
		shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
		maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.
		
		This map shows the flow route of floodwater across the landscape in the absence of 
		sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen if natural features 
		did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows estimation of the actual 
		value of those features.

		<description>
		Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
		ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
		moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular 
		portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that 
		reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account 
		the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of 
		the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services, 
		this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually 
		useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source 
		field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of 
		sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.
		
		This map shows runoff capable of harming people or damaging property when 
		accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, the density of actual flows represents floodwater that 
		impacts people or property, after accounting for flood routing due to topography,
		stream networks, and natural and artificial features that detain, slow, or 
		infiltrate floodwater.

		The *actual sink map* shows the portion of the sinks that actually contribute
		to depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns. For provisioning
		services, such sinks are responsible for reducing the benefits compared to their
		possible value. For preventive services, such sinks provide the actual
		service because they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching users.
		
		This map shows sinks that actively reduce floodwater, providing the benefit of 
		reduced flood damage for people.

		The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
		service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for 
		users located across the landscape.
		
		This map shows actual damage received by people and property when accounting for 
		sources of floodwater and their sinks and flow paths.

		The *blocked flow map* shows the flow paths that could have delivered the 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
		locations, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are selected from among 
		all actual flows.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss in possible flow of
		beneficial services to the users, and their density is proportional to the value lost. 
		For preventive services, the flow paths show the amount of the total flow that 
		was prevented by natural features from causing damage.
		
		This map shows flood flows that are absorbed by sinks prior to reaching human 
		beneficiaries of flood regulation.

		The *blocked source map* shows the part of the source map that had the possibility
		of reaching users given the location of the users and the flow dynamics, but
		was blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but lost before it reaches
		the users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.
		
		This map shows the portion of the total runoff that is absorbed, detained, or 
		slowed by the action of flood sinks.

		The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
		carrier based only on the source and the flow dynamics, but were not reached because 
		of the action of sinks. For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that 
		has not been accrued to users because of sinks; for preventive services, it shows 
		actual value accrued by users thanks to sink configuration. 
		
		For preventive services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
		value given the locations and quantity of users and natural sink features.
		
		This map shows people or economically valuable assets who are spared from flood 
		damage due to the flood regulation activity of sinks.
