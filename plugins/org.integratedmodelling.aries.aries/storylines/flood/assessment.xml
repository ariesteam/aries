		This model considers floodplain farmland as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Depending on their magnitude and
		timing, floods can have devastating effects on crops.  These models map flows from flood sources (precipitation), sinks (areas
		whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and beneficiary groups and link these
		via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map farms at risk of flooding, we simply intersect farmland
		with floodplain extents data for either the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		This model considers protection of public infrastructure as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Public infrastructure (e.g.,
		transportation, energy, or water infrastructure) can be damaged by floodwater or the use of such infrastructure can be impaired 
		by inundation (e.g., roads being impassable due to flooding).  These models map flows from flood sources (precipitation), sinks (areas
		whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and beneficiary groups and link these
		via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map public infrastructure at risk of flooding, 
		we simply intersect roads, railways, or other infrastructure with data delimiting the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		<description>
		*Possible flow maps* represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
		if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
		shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
		maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.
		
		This map shows the flow route of floodwater across the landscape in the absence of 
		sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen if natural features 
		did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows estimation of the actual 
		value of those features.

		<description>
		Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
		ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
		moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular 
		portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that 
		reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account 
		the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of 
		the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services, 
		this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually 
		useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source 
		field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of 
		sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.
		
		This map shows runoff capable of harming people or damaging property when 
		accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

		*Possible use maps* show the locations of users on the landscape that can receive a

		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, the density of actual flows represents floodwater that 
		impacts people or property, after accounting for flood routing due to topography,
		stream networks, and natural and artificial features that detain, slow, or 
		infiltrate floodwater.
