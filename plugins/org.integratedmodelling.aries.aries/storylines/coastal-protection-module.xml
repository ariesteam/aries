			<p>To conceptualize disturbance regulation (de Groot et al. 2002, MA 2005)
			as a set of ecosystem service benefits in ARIES, we can divide the
			benefits of this service into protection of economically valued
			assets from flooding along rivers, flooding in coastal zones, and
			prevention of landslides, mudslides, or avalanches. This chapter
			describes ecosystem service models for coastal flood regulation in
			Madagascar, while the ARIES Modeling guide covers flood regulation
			along rivers in several contexts. ARIES models to address landslide,
			mudslide, and avalanche protection have not yet been developed.</p>

			<p>High-profile tropical storm and tsunami events including the Indian
			Ocean tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 spurred great
			interest in understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in
			mitigating storm surge damage (Chatenoux and Peduzzi 2007, Day et al.
			2007, Cochard et al. 2008). Beyond these well-publicized disasters,
			tropical storms and tsunamis continue to cause loss of life and
			property in coastal zones around the world. In recent decades,
			population growth and coastal migration have placed more people and
			property at risk of coastal flooding, and have also damaged or caused
			outright loss of coastal ecosystems capable of mitigating flood
			damage. In addition, climate change threatens to warm the oceans and
			melt polar ice caps. The resulting sea level rise and increased
			number and size of tropical storms can further increase coastal flood
			risk (Emanuel 2005, Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009). These intersecting
			demographic, land use, and climate drivers mean that accurately
			valuing coastal ecosystem services and proactively protecting and
			managing these resources is important today and will be even more so
			in the future.</p>
