    <title>Introduction</title>
    <runninghead>CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and storage.</runninghead>
    <description language="html"><![CDATA[
    <p>This storyline computes estimates carbon sequestration by
    terrestrial ecosystems - the net removal of carbon dioxide
    (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere and the avoidance of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
    from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere via fire or
    deforestation. CO<sub>2</sub> uptake from the atmosphere largely occurs
    via photosynthesis. This carbon is stored as plant biomass
    (in the trunks, branches, leaves and roots of the plants)
    and organic matter in the soil. Terrestrial carbon sequestration
    depends on a series of factors including climatic conditions,
    vegetation structure and successional stage, and land use
    practices. </p>

    <p>In ARIES, we distinguish between ecosystem sources where
    carbon sequestration occurs. We also map sinks, or areas at risk
    of releasing stored carbon, largely via fire or deforestation.
    By subtracting the amount of stored carbon release from carbon
    sequestration in a region of interest, we are left with the carbon
    remaining available to offset anthropogenic emissions.  These greenhouse
    gas emitters are the beneficiaries of carbon sequestration and storage.
    Since greenhouse gas emitters benefit from the waste absorption
    capacity of the biosphere, carbon sequestration and storage can
    be divided among emitters. Existing and proposed systems to cap
    and assign property rights to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions
    use this framework. In other words:</p>

    <quote><em>Carbon sequestration (source) – stored carbon release (sink) = carbon
    available to offset emissions (use)</em></quote>

    <p>By mapping levels of carbon sequestration, stored carbon release, and
    anthropogenic emissions in a common unit (tonnes C/ha.yr), we can fully
    describe regional carbon balances – the level of a region’s net
    release or uptake of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. This will become increasingly
    important as local, state, and national governments continue to
    inventory greenhouse gas emissions and implement strategies to
    address climate change. Use of ecosystem carbon sequestration is rival and
    occurs at the global scale through atmospheric mixing.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
    <p>The presence of oxygen (aerobic environments) in soils allows respiration to take place,
    with CO<sub>2</sub> being released. In anaerobic environments such as wetlands, minimal soil
    respiration occurs, and greater buildup of soil carbon can occur (though generation of methane,
    a powerful greenhouse gas) often also occurs.  Wetland degradation, such as through declining
    water tables, can also allow oxidation of soil carbon, reducing their carbon storage.</p>
    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>Greater soil carbon storage is expected in wetland than upland environments, all else being equal.
    We currently do not consider the role of methane production by wetlands in the ARIES carbon models.</p>
