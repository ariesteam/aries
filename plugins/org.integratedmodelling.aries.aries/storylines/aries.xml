    <description title="Navigating an ARIES case study" language="confluence">
      With growing interest in using ecosystem services for decision making,
      demand has grown for systematic methods and tools to quantify ecosystem
      service values. ARIES maps the potential provision of ecosystem services
      (*sources*), their users (*use*), and biophysical features that can deplete
      service flows (*sinks*) using ecological process models or Bayesian models.
      ARIES then uses a series of agent-based flow algorithms to map actual
      *service flow* from ecosystems to people.

      h1. How to use the ARIES explorer

      ARIES models are presented as *storylines* that are computed on demand. You are looking at the main
      case study descriptor for the area you chose. The navigator below lists the modules that
      have storylines available to compute in this area (with a colored globe) and those that do not
      (with a grey globe). You can click on the modules to show their individual description and
      see the list of the storylines they contain.

      Each storyline is computed individually and tells a story about a specific aspect
      of a given ecosystem service in this area. The explorer for storylines is structured as
      a presentation that explains in detail the role, meaning and provenance of each
      input and output map.
