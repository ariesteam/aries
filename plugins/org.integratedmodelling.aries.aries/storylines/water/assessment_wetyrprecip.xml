    <description>
      This model considers surface water supply for various human beneficiary groups, including agriculture, industry,
      domestic use, and in-stream flow to support hydroelectric power generation, navigation, or recreation.  The model uses
      wet year annual precipitation as the primary source of surface water to estimate upper-bound values for water supply in a wet year.
      These models collectively map flows sources of surface water (precipitation, snowmelt, springs, baseflow to rivers, incoming
      water transfers), sinks (areas of groundwater infiltration or evapotranspiration), and beneficiary groups and
      link these via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.

This model considers groundwater supply for various human beneficiary groups, including agriculture, industry,
and domestic use.
These models map flows sources of groundwater (infiltration, artificial recharge), sinks (springs or baseflow),
and beneficiary groups and link these via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.

    <p>Annual precipitation, wet year.</p>
    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>Precipitation data are used as the most important "source" of surface and groundwater.  Particularly in
    arid and semiarid regions, where year-to-year rainfall is highly variable, it is more realistic for us to
    model the range of variability in water supply, based on a representative wet and dry year, than to model
    mean annual precipitation.  Precipitation runs off into water bodies where it is used or recharges
    groundwater through percolation to aquifers.  Data are currently at an annual time scale; finer temporal
    resolution could be added to the ARIES system in the future to better account for seasonal wet and dry
    seasons and their impacts on water supply.  These data are passed to the flow model to estimate actual
    water supply used given the locations of beneficiaries, their demand, and infiltration or evapotranspiration
    that occur as water flows across the landscape.</p>

      *Possible flow maps* represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
      if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
      shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
      maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.

      This map shows the movement of surface water via topography and stream networks,
      when not accounting for sinks (infiltration or evapotranspirative losses of surface water).

      Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
      ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
      moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular
      portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that
      reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account
      the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of
      the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually
      useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source
      field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of
      sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.

      This map shows surface water in its initial source location, that is capable of providing water
      to human beneficiaries when accounting for flow paths but not accounting for sinks
      (i.e., potentially can provide water to human beneficiaries).

      *Possible use maps* show the locations of users on the landscape that can receive a
      benefit due to flow connections with a source of an ecosystem service carrier, but may
      or may not actually receive the carrier due to the action of sinks.  For provisioning
      services, potential use identifies areas where it is physically possible for a benefit to
      be received.  For preventive services, potential use identifies areas that may be damaged
      by a detrimental carrier if sinks do not prevent such damage.

      This map represents water actually reaching a user, but not accounting for the activity of sinks.

      The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
      humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
      users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      In this case, the density of actual flows represents the movement of surface water
      when accounting for flow paths and sinks (i.e., transitions from surface to
      groundwater, or evapotranspirative losses of surface water).

      The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to
      the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics.
      For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that
      actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
      where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
      were neutralized by sinks are not shown.

      This map shows sources of surface water transitions that are capable of providing
      water to human beneficiaries when accounting for surface flow paths

      The *actual sink map* shows the portion of the sinks that actually contribute
      to depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns. For provisioning
      services, such sinks are responsible for reducing the benefits compared to their
      possible value. For preventive services, such sinks provide the actual
      service because they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching users.

      This map shows the locations where surface water transitions into groundwater
      (via infiltration) or atmospheric water (via evapotranspiration), becoming unavailable
      for use as surface water.

      users located across the landscape.

      This map shows the portion of demand for water satisfied by the actual supply of surface water.

    <description>
      The *inaccessible source map* shows those areas of the source map whose values are
      irrelevant to the delivery of the service, because of the impossibility of reaching
      users given the relevant ecosystem services flow path. For provisioning services, this
      is the portion of the value that must be subtracted from the total source map to
      define a maximum potential benefit for the users. For preventive services, it
      shows those areas that have no potential of producing damage because the
      flow dynamics prevent the carrier from reaching any significant user.

      This map shows the source locations of surface water that are not available
      to human users because their flow paths do not move them in a direction where
      they can be accessed by human beneficiaries.

      The *inaccessible use map* shows those areas of the use map where beneficiaries fail
      to receive a service because of the impossibility of reaching users given the relevant
      ecosystem services flow path.

      This map shows areas of demand for surface water that goes unsatisfied due to
      a lack of surface or groundwater flow connections between sources of water and
      the location of water users.

    <description>
      The *blocked flow map* shows the flow paths that could have delivered the
      service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
      locations, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are selected from among
      all actual flows.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss in possible flow of
      beneficial services to the users, and their density is proportional to the value lost.
      For preventive services, the flow paths show the amount of the total flow that
      was prevented by natural features from causing damage.

      This map shows water flows that fail to reach a user because it encountered a
      sink and transitions from surface water into the atmospheric or groundwater.

      The *blocked source map* shows the part of the source map that had the possibility
      of reaching users given the location of the users and the flow dynamics, but
      was blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to value produced by the environment but lost before it reaches
      the users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.

      This map shows the source locations of surface water that fails to reach a user
      due to their encountering a sink and transitioning from surface water
      into the atmosphere or groundwater.

      The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
      carrier based only on the source and the flow dynamics, but were not reached because
      of the action of sinks. For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      has not been accrued to users because of sinks; for preventive services, it shows
      actual value accrued by users thanks to sink configuration.

      For preventive services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
      value given the locations and quantity of users and natural sink features.

      This map shows demand for surface water that goes unsatisfied due to the action of
      sinks that transition water from surface water to inaccessible atmospheric moisture or
      groundwater.
