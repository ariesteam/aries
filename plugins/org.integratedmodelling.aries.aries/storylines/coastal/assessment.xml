		<description><![CDATA[
			<p>This storyline, developed with financial support from the 
			<a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank">UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a>,
			describes aspects of coastal flood regulation in Madagascar.
			This island's coastal ecosystems include dunes, coral reefs, seagrass, and
			mangroves, all of which can play a role in dissipating wind and wave energy 
			generated by coastal storms.  Unlike more northerly nations bordering the 
			Indian Ocean, Madagascar is rarely subject to earthquake-generated tsunami 
			waves. However, eastern Madagascar is highly susceptible to tropical storms 
			coming off the southwestern Indian Ocean.  Its storms are relatively poorly 
			studied, with limited infrastructure for measuring and modeling storm magnitude 
			and impact versus other tropical storm prone regions in more developed parts 
			of the world (Naeraa and Jury 1998).</p>  
	
			<p>The coastal storm protection models used here are intended as a proof-of-concept 
			framework to spatially link: 1) storm wave sources; 2) ecosystem “sinks” that 
			mitigate wave damage; and 3) social groups or assets that are susceptible to harm 
			by coastal flooding.  These models use historic storm track, wind speed, and 
			atmospheric pressure data from tropical storms that occurred in a specified 
			region of time. Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and Litanne, three severe 
			storms that made landfall near the port of Toamasina in 1994, are used in the 
			first version of this model, based on availability of information from 
			Naeraa and Jury (1998). The authors modeled aspects of these storms and their 
			attendant storm surges, providing data for calibration of model results.  
			Our model can easily be applied to other historical storm tracks in Madagascar or 
			elsewhere and to simulated future storm tracks or other large wave events, 
			such as tsunamis. These models can also be relatively easily generalized to other 
			parts of the world, as they rely on global datasets for historical storms, coastal 
			ecosystems capable of mitigating storm surges, and lives and property at risk of 
			flood damage.</p>

		<description>
		Potential flow maps represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
		if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
		shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
		maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.
		
		This map shows the flow route of wave energy across the land and seascape in the 
		absence of sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen
		if natural features did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows 
		estimation of the actual value of those features.

		Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
		ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
		moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular 
		portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that 
		reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account 
		the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of 
		the carrier. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the source of benefits 
		that has the potential of being actually useful. For preventive services, this 
		corresponds to the portion of the source field that could actually cause damage 
		to people. The location and strength of sinks determines how much of the source 
		actually reaches the users.
		
		This specific map represents what specific sources of waves are capable of harming 
		people or damaging property when accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

		The *actual flow density* map depicts the trajectories that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these trajectories
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these trajectories deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the trajectories show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this specific case, the density of actual flows represent the wave energy that 
		impacts people or property, after accounting for wave routing due to winds, 
		geophysics, and natural features that deplete their magnitude.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to

		were neutralized by sinks are not shown.

		The *unused source map" shows those areas of the source map whose values are 
		irrelevant to the delivery of the service, because of the impossibility of reaching
		users given the relevant ecosystem services flow path. For provisioning services, this
		is the portion of the value that must be subtracted from the total source map to
		define a maximum potential benefit for the users. For preventive services, it
		shows those areas that have no potential of producing damage because the 
		flow dynamics prevent the carrier from reaching any significant user.
		
		This map shows wind or waves that do not have people or economically valuable 
		assets lying in their path.

		The *blocked flow map* depicts the trajectories that could have delivered the

		all actual flows.
		
		For provisioning services, these trajectories show the loss in possible flow of
		beneficial services to the users, and their density is proportional to the value lost. 
		For preventive services, the trajectories show the amount of the total flow that 
		was prevented by natural features from causing damage.
		
		This map shows wave or wind energy that is absorbed by natural features prior to 
		reaching human beneficiaries that could be damaged by wind or waves.

		The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
