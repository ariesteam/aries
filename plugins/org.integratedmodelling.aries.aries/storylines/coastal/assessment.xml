		<description><![CDATA[
			<p>This storyline, developed with financial support from the 
			<a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank">UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a>,
			describes aspects of coastal flood regulation in Madagascar.
			This island's coastal ecosystems include dunes, coral reefs, seagrass, and
			mangroves, all of which play a role in dissipating wind and wave energy 
			generated by coastal storms.  Unlike more northerly nations bordering the 
			Indian Ocean, Madagascar is rarely subject to earthquake-generated tsunami 
			waves. However, eastern Madagascar is highly susceptible to tropical storms 
			coming off the southwestern Indian Ocean.  Its storms are relatively poorly 
			studied, with limited infrastructure for measuring and modeling storm magnitude 
			and  impact versus other tropical storm prone regions in more developed parts 
			of the world (Naeraa and Jury 1998).</p>  
	
			<p>The coastal storm protection models used here are intended as a proof-of-concept 
			framework to spatially link: 1) storm wave sources; 2) ecosystem “sinks” that 
			mitigate wave damage; and 3) social groups or assets that are susceptible to harm 
			by coastal flooding.  These models use historic storm track, wind speed, and 
			atmospheric pressure data from tropical storms that occurred in a specified 
			region of time. Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and Litanne, three severe 
			storms that made landfall near the port of Toamasina in 1994, are used in the 
			first version of this model, based on availability of information from 
			Naeraa and Jury (1998). The Authors modeled aspects of these storms and their 
			attendant storm surges, providing data for calibration of model results.  
			Our model can easily be applied to other historical storm tracks in Madagascar 
			and to simulated future storm tracks, or to other simulated large wave events, 
			such as tsunamis. These models can also be relatively easily generalized to other 
			parts of the world, as they rely on global datasets for historical storms, coastal 
			ecosystems capable of mitigating storm surges, and lives and property at risk of 
			flood damage.</p>

		<description>
		Potential flow maps represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
		if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
		shows the maximum amount of flow. In provisioning services, this corresponds to the
		maximum potential benefit; in preventative services, the maximum potential damage.
		
		This specific map shows the flow route of wave energy across the land and seascape 
		in the absence of sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen
		if natural features did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows 
		computing the actual value of those features.

		Even in the absence of sinks, not all the source component actually has the
		ability of flowing to the users, because of the details of how the carrier
		moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows to identify which particular portion of the total source
		field is actually generating carriers that reach the users, independent of the
		existence of sinks but taking into account the result of use analysis, 
		the structure of the landscape and the
		modalities of transmission of the carrier. In provisioning services, this 
		corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually
		useful. In preventative services, this corresponds to the portion of the source
		field that needs to be worried about. The configuration of sinks will decide
		how much of this source actually reaches the users.
		
		This specific map represents what specific sources of waves are capable of harming 
		people or damaging  property when accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

		The *actual flow density* map depicts the trajectories that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected among the total flow density to only show these trajectories
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		In provisioning services, these trajectories deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. In preventative services,
		the trajectories show how much of the carrier gets to users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this specific case, the density of actual flows represent the wave 
		energy that hits users and assets, after accounting for their routing due to
		winds, geophysics, and natural features that deplete their magnitude.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is actually

		or damage property when accounting for flow paths and sinks.

		The *unused source map" reveals those areas of the source map whose values do not
		influence the delivery of the service, because of the impossibility of reaching
		users given the dynamics of ecosystem services flow. In provisioning services, this
		is the portion of the value that must be subtracted from the total source map to
		define a maximum potential benefit for the users. In preventative services, it
		shows those areas that have no potential of producing damage because of the 
		flow dynamics prevents the carrier from reaching any significant user.
		
		In this specific case, the map shows wind or waves that do not have people or 
		economically valuable assets lying in their path.

		The *actual sink map* shows the portion of the sink map that actually contributes

		service because they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching the users. 
		
		In this case, the image shows those sinks that actively reduce wind or waves,

		The *blocked flow map* depicts the trajectories that could have delivered the 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow dynamics and the source and user
		configuration, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are 
		selected among the total flow density.
		
		In provisioning services, these trajectories show the loss in possible flow of
		services to the
		users, and their density is proportional to the value lost. In preventative services,
		the trajectories show the amount of the total flow that was prevented by natural
		features to produce damage.
		
		In this specific case, the map shows flood or wind flows that are absorbed by 
		natural features prior to reaching human beneficiaries of wind or wave regulation.

		The *blocked source map* shows the part of the source map that had the possibility
		of reaching users given the location of the users and the dynamic of flow, but
		was blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. In provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but lost before it reaches
		the users. In preventative services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted to users but was blocked by natural features.
		
		In this specific case, the map shows the portion of coastal wind and wave front 
		whose damage is reduced or nullified by the action of natural features.

		The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the

		not reached because of the action of sinks. In provisioning services, the map
		shows possible value that has not been accrued by users because of sinks; in 
		preventative services, it shows actual value being accrued by users thanks to
		sink configuration. 
		
		In preventative services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
		value given the configuration of users and natural features.
		
		In this case, the map shows people or economically valuable assets who are 
		spared from coastal flood or wind damage due to the flood or wind regulation 
		activity of natural features.
