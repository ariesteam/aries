    <description><![CDATA[
    <p>This storyline, developed with financial support from the
    <a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank">UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a>,
    describes aspects of coastal flood regulation in Madagascar.
    This island's coastal ecosystems include dunes, coral reefs, seagrass, and
    mangroves, all of which can play a role in dissipating wind and wave energy
    generated by coastal storms.  Unlike more northerly nations bordering the
    Indian Ocean, Madagascar is rarely subject to earthquake-generated tsunami
    waves. However, eastern Madagascar is highly susceptible to tropical storms
    coming off the southwestern Indian Ocean.  Its storms are relatively poorly
    studied, with limited infrastructure for measuring and modeling storm magnitude
    and impact versus other tropical storm prone regions in more developed parts
    of the world (Naeraa and Jury 1998).</p>

    <p>The coastal storm protection models used here are intended as a proof-of-concept
    framework to spatially link: 1) storm wave sources; 2) ecosystem "sinks" that
    mitigate wave damage; and 3) social groups or assets that are susceptible to harm
    by coastal flooding.  These models use historic storm track, wind speed, and
    atmospheric pressure data from tropical storms that occurred in a specified
    region of time. Tropical Storms Daisy, Geralda, and Litanne, three severe
    storms that made landfall near the port of Toamasina in 1994, are used in the
    first version of this model, based on availability of information from
    Naeraa and Jury (1998). The authors modeled aspects of these storms and their
    attendant storm surges, providing data for calibration of model results.
    Our model can easily be applied to other historical storm tracks in Madagascar or
    elsewhere and to simulated future storm tracks or other large wave events,
    such as tsunamis. These models can also be relatively easily generalized to other
    parts of the world, as they rely on global datasets for historical storms, coastal
    ecosystems capable of mitigating storm surges, and lives and property at risk of
    flood damage.</p>

      This model considers populations that live in coastal flood zones as the
      beneficiaries of coastal storm protection. Decile values of populations at risk
      of coastal flooding is thus identified as the use model and there is no
      requirement for a probabilistic model.  In parts of the world where coastal
      flood zones have been mapped, we could overlay flood zones and population density
      to more accurately map lives at risk, rather than using the coarser resolution
      map shown here.

    <p>Different vegetation types will dissipate wave energy at different rates.</p>
    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>The type of terrestrial vegetation encountered on the coast is an important
    determinant of how much wave and wind energy can be absorbed by the ecosystem
    before it reaches humans assets and settlements.  We assume that forests and wetlands
    are most effective in mitigating wave energy, followed by shrubland and herbaceous
    ecosystems, with other vegetation types (urban and agriculture) providing minimal
    protection.

    These data are used as input to the sink model, which estimates the total wave
    mitigation potential provided by natural features.  The sink model, in turn,
    is used by the flow model to determine actual damage inflicted by storms and
    separate the influences of geomorphic wave mitigation (which would occur with
    or without ecosystems that provide wave mitigation) and the contribution of
    ecosystems in mitigating wave energy.</p>

*Theoretical source maps* show the location and quantity of an ecosystem services

The height of coastal waves generated at a certain part of the seascape.
This is the source of the potentially damaging wave created by storms or
tsunamis before being intercepted by natural features along the coasts.
It is estimated by processing historical storm records along recorded
storm tracks, though hypothetical future storm tracks could also be modeled.

The source data are used as input to the flow model that computes how much
wave energy is dissipated by ecosystems and how much protection benefit
is accrued by humans in the process. These source data therefore do not
account for flows.

The *sink* model estimates the amount of service carrier (wave energy,
estimated in meters) intercepted along the flow paths. For preventive
services like coastal flood regulation, the sink model represents the
actual benefit to humans, as it reduces the amount of a detrimental
carrier (in this case, wave energy) capable of inflicting damage to the users.
These *theoretical sink maps* are outputs from probabilistic or deterministic
models and are used as inputs to flow models to determine levels of possible,
actual, inaccessible, and blocked ecosystem service provision and use.

This map of potential wave mitigation is produced from probabilistic models of all
ecosystem-related factors likely to intercept wave energy alogn their damaging
path towards the coast. As all "theoretical" ecosystem service maps, it is used
as an input to the flow model and therefore does not account for flows.

      *Possible flow maps* represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
      if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
      shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
      maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.

      This map shows the flow route of wave energy across the land and seascape in the
      absence of sinks. Therefore it computes the maximum damage that would happen
      if natural features did not intercept it, and provides a baseline that allows
      estimation of the actual value of those features.

      Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
      ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
      moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular
      portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that
      reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account
      the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of
      the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually
      useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source
      field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of
      sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.

      This map represents what specific sources of waves are capable of harming
      people or damaging property when accounting for flow paths but not sinks.

      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the

      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      In this specific case, the density of actual flows represents the wave energy that
      impacts people or property, after accounting for wave routing due to winds,

      The *blocked source map* shows the part of the source map that had the possibility
      of reaching users given the location of the users and the flow dynamics, but
      was blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to value produced by the environment but lost before it reaches
      the users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.

      This map shows the portion of coastal wave energy whose damage potential is reduced
      by the action of natural features.

      The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
      carrier based only on the source and the flow dynamics, but were not reached because
      of the action of sinks. For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      has not been accrued to users because of sinks; for preventive services, it shows
      actual value accrued by users thanks to sink configuration.

      For preventive services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
      value given the locations and quantity of users and natural sink features.

      This map shows people or economically valuable assets who are spared from coastal
      flood or wind damage due to the flood or wind mitigating activity of natural features.
