		<description><![CDATA[
			<p>To better idenfify the distinct economic benefits and ecological processes 
			related to disturbance regulation, we separately consider the protection of 
			life and property from flooding along rivers, flooding in coastal zones, and
			prevention of landslides, mudslides, or avalanches. This module
			assembles all the storylines related to for coastal flood regulation
			in the user-defined region.</p>

			<p>High-profile tropical storms such as Hurricane Katrina and tsunami 
			events in the Indian Ocean in 2004 and Japan in 2011 have spurred great
			interest in understanding the role of coastal ecosystems in
			mitigating storm surge damage. Beyond these well-publicized disasters,
			many other tropical storms and tsunamis continue to cause loss of life and
			property in coastal zones around the world. In recent decades,
			population growth and coastal migration have placed more people and
			property at risk of coastal flooding, and have also damaged or caused
			outright loss of coastal ecosystems capable of mitigating flood
			damage. In addition, climate change threatens to warm the oceans and
			melt polar ice caps. The resulting sea level rise and increased
			number and size of tropical storms can further increase coastal flood
			risk. These intersecting demographic, land use, and climate drivers 
			mean that accurately valuing coastal ecosystem services and proactively 
			protecting and managing these resources is important today and will 
			become even more so in the future.</p>
