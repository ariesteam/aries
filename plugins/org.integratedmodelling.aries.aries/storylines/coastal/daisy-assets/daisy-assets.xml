  <title>Coastal Assets - Tropical Storm Daisy</title>
  <runninghead>Avoided coastal storm surge and risk of property damage
  from Tropical Storm Daisy in 1994</runninghead>
  <description>Assessment of sources (of coastal waves), beneficiaries
  (property at risk), sinks (ecosystems and geomorphic features
  providing storm surge mitigation) and ecosystem service flows
  relevant to protection of property in Madagascar.  This model uses
  data referring to Tropical Storm Daisy in 1994.  Real-time running
  of flow models takes tens of minutes to compute.</description>
