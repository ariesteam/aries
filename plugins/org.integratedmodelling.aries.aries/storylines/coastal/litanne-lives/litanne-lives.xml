  <runninghead>Avoided coastal storm surge 
  and risk of lives lost from Tropical Storm Litanne in 1994</runninghead>
  <description>Assessment of sources (of coastal waves), beneficiaries (lives at risk), 
  	sinks (ecosystems and geomorphic features providing storm surge mitigation) 
  	and ecosystem service flows relevant to protection of lives of coastal residents 
  	in Madagascar. This model uses data referring to Tropical Storm Litanne in 1994. 
  	Real-time running of flow models takes tens of minutes to compute.</description>
