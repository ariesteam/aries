	<runninghead>Values resulting from open space proximity.</runninghead>
	<description>Aesthetic values are typically defined as the value derived from views or proximity 
			to open space.  These values often accrue to housing or property values and are often 
			measured using hedonic pricing.  Homeowners typically gain some combination of benefits 
			through sensory enjoyment of views of nearby open space, proximity to open space for 
			recreation, or privacy.  This storyline maps ecosytem service provision, use, and flows for
			open space proximity, including the type and quality of open space, location and type of 
			housing, the presence of highways that can block easy access to open space, and flow models
			to connect beneficiaries to open space via walking simulation.</description>

		This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality open space, and the impact 
		of open space on property values.  The source model quantifies open space quality, the sink model maps 
		highways that reduce privacy and obstruct direct access to open space, and the use model maps the location 
		of homeowners.  By combining these maps with a walking simulation model, we can analyze actual open space 
		proximity its potential impact on property values.

		Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
		ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
		moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular 
		portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that 
		reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account 
		the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of 
		the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services, 
		this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually 
		useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source 
		field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of 
		sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.
		
		This map shows open space providing value when accounting for proximity and the 
		location of homeowners but not highways that limit local access.
