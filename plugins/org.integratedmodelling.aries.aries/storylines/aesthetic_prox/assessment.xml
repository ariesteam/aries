  <title>Open space proximity</title>
  <runninghead>Values resulting from open space
  proximity</runninghead>
  <description>Aesthetic values are typically defined as the value
  derived from views or proximity to open space. These values often
  accrue to housing or property values and are often measured using
  hedonic pricing. Homeowners typically gain some combination of
  benefits through sensory enjoyment of views of nearby open space,
  proximity to open space for recreation, or privacy. This storyline
  maps ecosytem service provision, use, and flows for open space
  proximity, including the type and quality of open space, location and
  type of housing, the presence of highways that can block easy access
  to open space, and flow models to connect beneficiaries to open space
  via walking simulation.</description>

      This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward
      providing high-quality open space, and the impact of open space on
      property values. The source model quantifies open space quality, the
      sink model maps highways that reduce privacy and obstruct direct
      access to open space, and the use model maps the location of
      homeowners. By combining these maps with a walking simulation model,
      actual open space proximity its potential impact on property values
      can be analyzed.

      *Possible flow maps* show the path that the carrier of the
      service would take if it was not intercepted by sinks. As such it
      considers source and use models and shows the maximum amount of flow.

      damage.

      which specific sources actually generate carriers that reach users,
      independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account use
      values and the carrier flow paths. Even in the absence of sinks, not
      all of a source quantity can actually reach users, because of the
      route that an ecosystem service carrier moves across the landscape.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to the source of
      benefits that has the potential of being actually useful. For
      preventive services, this corresponds to the sources that could
      actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of sinks

    <description>
      *Inaccessible use maps* shows potential users that cannot
      receive a service due to a lack of flow routes linking source and user
      locations.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to value produced by
      the environment that cannot be reached by users. For preventive
      services, it corresponds to damage that could have been inflicted on
      users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.

      This map shows homeowners lacking any proximity to open space
      due to their location (typically in urban areas).

      *Blocked flow maps* show flow paths that could have delivered an
      ecosystem service to humans based on the flow routes and source and
      user locations, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are
      selected from among all actual flows.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss of
      possible beneficial service flow to users, and their density is
      proportional to the value lost. For preventive services, the flow
      paths show the amount of the total flow that was prevented by natural
      features from causing damage.

      This map shows flows of open space proximity toward homeowners
      that are blocked by highways.

      *Blocked source maps* show sources that had the possibility of
      reaching users given the location of users and flow dynamics, but were
      blocked from doing so because of the action of sinks.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to value produced by
      the environment but lost before it could reach the users. For
      preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but was blocked by natural features.

      This map shows open space that is blocked by the action of sinks
      (highways).

      *Blocked use maps* show users that would have received a service
      carrier based on source and flow dynamics, but did not because of the
      action of sinks.

      For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      were prevented by sinks from reaching users; for preventive services,
      it shows actual value accrued by users from sinks that blocked
      damaging flows. For preventive services, therefore, this map is the
      ultimate quantification of value given the locations and quantity of
      users and sink features.

      This map shows homeowners who would receive benefits from open
      space proximity but have their access blocked by highways.
