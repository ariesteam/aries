			<p>Aesthetic values are typically defined as the value derived from views 
			or proximity to open space.  These values often accrue to housing or property values 
			and are often measured using hedonic pricing.  Park visitors (e.g., hikers) and 
			drivers along scenic highways may also value scenic views, although we consider these
			values in ARIES using recreation models.  Spatial mapping of homeowners is relatively 
			straightforward, as housing units and viewshed values have been frequently analyzed 
			in hedonic studies of amenity values.  View values rely on an unimpeded line 
			of sight to visually significant objects such as mountains or water bodies.</p>

			<p>Sources of aesthetically valuable views include mountains, water bodies, or specific
			vegetation types such as forests or riparian areas.  Users of aesthetic views are found 
			in residential areas.  As a view travels from source to user, it may be physically blocked 
			by buildings, trees, or topography.  Its quality may be depleted by air pollution or visual 
			blight, such as highways, forest clearcuts, transmission lines, mines, or visually 
			unappealing land use including commercial, industrial, or transportation.  Such sinks, or 
			locations of visual blight, can also be mapped.  Higher concentrations of residential users 
			or visual blight lead to higher levels of ecosystem service use or sinks, respectively.</p>
