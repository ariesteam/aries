  <title>Aesthetic viewsheds</title>
  <runninghead>Values resulting from scenic views of ecosystems.</runninghead>
  <description>Aesthetic values are typically defined as the value derived from views or proximity
  to open space.  These values often accrue to housing or property values and are often
  measured using hedonic pricing.  Homeowners typically gain some combination of benefits
  through sensory enjoyment of views of nearby open space, proximity to open space for
  recreation, or privacy.  This storyline maps ecosytem service provision, use, and flows for
  aesthetic viewsheds, including the type and quality of views, location and type of
  housing, the presence of features that block or degrade view quality, and flow models
  to connect beneficiaries to high quality views via a line-of-sight model.</description>

    <description>
      This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality views and their impact on
      property values.  The source model maps areas that contain beautiful views, the sink model maps areas with
      objects that degrade views, and the use model maps the location of homeowners.  By combining these maps with a
      line of sight model, we can analyze actual view quality and its potential impact on property values.  In the
      recreation module, we use a similar set of models to map and value viewsheds as they contribute to recreational
      experiences, such as on trails, mountain summits, or scenic drives.

    <h1>Role in models</h1>
    <p>This is the output of the viewshed use model, and estimates the potential property value benefit
    that could be provided by high-quality views, based on relevant input data.</p>
    <h1>Representation</h1>
    <p>The data are in abstract units from 0-100, representing relative potential property value benefit
    as reflected by the presence of housing and property values. As the output of the models is probabilistic,
    each point contains the probability distribution for potential visual blight.  The distribution
    can be visualized by clicking on the map; the mean value and the coefficient of variation are
    reported along with the probabilities.</p>

    <p>This map has been computed at your request by a Bayesian model built and calibrated by the

      *Possible flow maps* represent the path that the carrier of the service would take
      if it was not intercepted by sinks.  As such it considers source and use models and
      shows the maximum amount of flow. For provisioning services, this corresponds to the
      maximum potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential damage.

      This map shows the flow of views as aesthetic information from natural areas toward
      homeowners, when not accounting for sinks).

      Even in the absence of sinks, not all of a source quantity actually has the
      ability to reach users, because of the route that an ecosystem service carrier
      moves across the landscape. Flow analysis allows us to identify which particular
      portion of the total source quantity is actually generating carriers that
      reach the users, independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account
      the result of use values, the structure of the landscape and the flow paths of
      the carrier, producing this *possible source map*. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to the source of benefits that has the potential of being actually
      useful. For preventive services, this corresponds to the portion of the source
      field that could actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of
      sinks determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.

      This map shows open space providing views when accounting for lines of sight and
      the location of homeowners but not visual blight.

      *Possible use maps* show the locations of users on the landscape that can receive a
      benefit due to flow connections with a source of an ecosystem service carrier, but may
      or may not actually receive the carrier due to the action of sinks.  For provisioning
      services, potential use identifies areas where it is physically possible for a benefit to
      be received.  For preventive services, potential use identifies areas that may be damaged
      by a detrimental carrier if sinks do not prevent such damage.

      This map shows homeowners benefiting from views when sources of high-quality views and
      their flow paths are accounted for, but visual blight is not.

      The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
      humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
      users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      This map shows the actual flow of views as aesthetic information from
      natural areas toward homeowners, when accounting for sinks and flow paths.

      The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to
      the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics.
      For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that
      actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
      where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
      were neutralized by sinks are not shown.

      This map shows open space that actually provides views when accounting for flow
      paths, sinks, and the location of beneficiaries.

      The *actual sink map* shows the portion of the sinks that actually contribute
      to depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns. For provisioning
      services, such sinks are responsible for reducing the benefits compared to their
      possible value. For preventive services, such sinks provide the actual
      service because they prevent a damaging carrier from reaching users.

      This map shows areas of visual blight located between visually valuable views
      and beneficiaries, that actually degrades high quality views.

      The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
      carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
      users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.

      This map shows homeowners who lack any views due to their lack of flow connections
      (i.e., living in areas too flat or distant from high quality views).

      The *blocked flow map* shows the flow paths that could have delivered the

      locations, but did not because of the action of sinks. These are selected from among
      all actual flows.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss in possible flow of
      beneficial services to the users, and their density is proportional to the value lost.
      For preventive services, the flow paths show the amount of the total flow that
      was prevented by natural features from causing damage.

      This map shows flows of views as aesthetic information toward homeowners that are
      blocked by visual blight.

      The *blocked use map* shows those users that would have been reached by the service
      carrier based only on the source and the flow dynamics, but were not reached because
      of the action of sinks. For provisioning services, the map shows possible value that
      has not been accrued to users because of sinks; for preventive services, it shows
      actual value accrued by users thanks to sink configuration.

      For preventive services, therefore, this map is the ultimate quantification of
      value given the locations and quantity of users and natural sink features.

      This map shows homeowners who would receive benefits from views but have their
      views degraded by visual blight.
