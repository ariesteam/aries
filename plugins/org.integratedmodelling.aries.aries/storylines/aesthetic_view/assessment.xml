  <title>Aesthetic viewsheds</title>
  <runninghead>Values resulting from scenic views of
  ecosystems.</runninghead>
  <description>Aesthetic values are typically defined as the value
  derived from views or proximity to open space. These values often
  accrue to housing or property values and are often measured using
  hedonic pricing. Homeowners typically gain some combination of
  benefits through sensory enjoyment of views of nearby open space,
  proximity to open space for recreation, or privacy. This storyline
  maps ecosytem service provision, use, and flows for aesthetic
  viewsheds, including the type and quality of views, location and type
  of housing, the presence of features that block or degrade view
  quality, and flow models to connect beneficiaries to high quality
  views via a line-of-sight model.</description>

    <description>
      This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward
      providing high-quality views and their impact on property values. The
      source model maps areas that contain high-quality views, the sink
      model maps areas with objects that degrade views, and the use model
      maps the location of homeowners. By combining these maps with a line
      of sight model, actual view quality and its potential impact on
      property values can be analyzed. In the recreation module, a similar
      set of models can be used to map and value viewsheds as they
      contribute to recreational experiences, such as on trails, mountain
      summits, or scenic drives.

    <h1>Representation</h1> <p>The data are in abstract units from
    0-100, representing relative potential property value benefit as
    reflected by the presence of housing and property values. As the
    output of the models is probabilistic, each point contains the

    can be visualized by clicking on the map; the mean value and the
    coefficient of variation are reported along with the

      *Possible flow maps* show the path that the carrier of the
      service would take if it was not intercepted by sinks. As such it
      considers source and use models and shows the maximum amount of flow.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to the maximum
      potential benefit; for preventive services, the maximum potential
      damage.

      This map shows the flow of views from natural areas toward
      homeowners when not accounting for sinks.

      *Possible source maps*, generated through flow analysis, show
      which specific sources actually generate carriers that reach users,
      independent of the existence of sinks but taking into account use
      values and the carrier flow paths. Even in the absence of sinks, not
      all of a source quantity can actually reach users, because of the
      route that an ecosystem service carrier moves across the landscape.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to the source of
      benefits that has the potential of being actually useful. For
      preventive services, this corresponds to the sources that could
      actually cause damage to people. The location and strength of sinks
      determines how much of the source actually reaches the users.

      This map shows open space providing views when accounting for
      lines of sight and the location of homeowners but not visual blight.

      *Possible use maps* show the locations of users that can receive
      a benefit due to flow connections with a source of an ecosystem
      service carrier, but may or may not actually receive the carrier due
      to the action of sinks.

      For provisioning services, potential use identifies areas where
      it is physically possible for a benefit to be received. For preventive
      services, potential use identifies areas that may be damaged by a
      detrimental carrier if sinks do not prevent such damage.

      This map shows homeowners benefiting from views when sources of
      high-quality views and their flow paths are accounted for, but visual
      blight is not.

      *Actual flow maps* show the flow paths that deliver actual
      services to beneficiaries. These are selected from the total flow
      density to only show these flow paths that are not depleted by sinks
      and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable
      benefits to the users and the density is proportional to the value
      accrued. For preventive services, the flow paths show how much of the
      carrier reaches users, delivering actual damage.

      This map shows the actual flow of aesthetic views from natural
      areas toward homeowners, when accounting for sinks and flow paths.

      For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a
      benefit that actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive

      *Actual sink maps* shows the sinks that actually contribute to
      depleting a service carrier given its flow patterns.

      For provisioning services, such sinks reduce benefits to users
      compared to their possible value. For preventive services, such sinks
      provide the actual service because they prevent a damaging carrier
      from reaching users.

      This map shows areas of visual blight located between visually
      valuable views and beneficiaries - features that actually degrade high
      quality views.

      *Inaccessible use maps* shows potential users that cannot
      receive a service due to a lack of flow routes linking source and user
      locations.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to value produced by
      the environment that cannot be reached by users. For preventive
      services, it corresponds to damage that could have been inflicted on
      users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.

      This map shows homeowners who lack any views due to their lack
      of flow connections (i.e., living in areas too flat or distant from
      high quality views).

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show the loss of
      possible beneficial service flow to users, and their density is
      proportional to the value lost. For preventive services, the flow
      paths show the amount of the total flow that was prevented by natural
      features from causing damage.

      This map shows flows of views as aesthetic information toward
      homeowners that are blocked by visual blight.
