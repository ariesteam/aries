			<p>Fish resources play multiple roles in the world's economies and
			social ... Among these: LIST VARIOUS</>
			
			<li>
			<it>Subsistence harvesting of ecosystem goods – food, fuel,
			fiber, and other basic resources – is a critical contributor to
			livelihoods in much of the developing world as well as in parts of
			developed nations (MA 2005). These ecosystem goods have been termed
			the “GDP of the poor” (TEEB 2008), since they provide employment and
			livelihoods for so many of the world’s poor while not being monetized
			as part of traditional national economic accounts like GDP.</it>
			</li>

			<p>This module collects the fisheries-related storylines that have been
			defined in ARIES and can be
			applied to the region of interest you have identified. As new models are
			added to ARIES, new storylines will appear and more options will be given
			for scenario analysis. Please come back to this module for updates.</p>
