	<description>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward recreational activities, as opposed to the
	infrastructure, skills, and preferences of individuals participating in a given activity.  Source models map
	the potential recreational quality of a given part of the landscape for a particular activity.  Flow models 
	can be used to connect beneficiaries to areas where recreation occurs.</description>

		This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality areas for hunting, specifically for 
		javelina (peccaries), one of several important game species in southeast Arizona.  The source model maps areas where 
		javelina habitat is present, land that is accessible to the public, and areas where surface water is present as having 
		high potential value for javelina hunting.  By combining this map with information about recreational travel patterns 
		and site selection, we can map the connections between recreational users and specific sites, showing recreational use 
		alongside other ecosystem services provided by recreational areas.

 <!-- Flow models and maps are not yet active for recreation.  Concepts are described below so that they

		<description>
		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, this map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas, based on 
		transportation networks, recreational preferences, site quality, and a distance decay 
		function.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to 
		the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics. 
		For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that 
		actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
		where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
		were neutralized by sinks are not shown.
		 
		This map shows the amount of recreational use actually seen at a recreation area 
		when accounting for demand and spatial flows of visitors.

		The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
		service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for 
		users located across the landscape.
		
		This map shows the residential location of users who actually travel to sites 
		via “recreation flows” to engage in recreational activities at source areas.

		<description>
		The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
		locations.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
		but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services, 
		the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.
		
		This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility via transportation 
		networks makes their use level more limited than their attractiveness alone would 
		dictate.

		<description>
		The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
		carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
		users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.
		
		This map shows users too distant from a recreational resource to benefit from it.
