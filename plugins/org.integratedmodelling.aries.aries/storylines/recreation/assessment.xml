	<description>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward recreational activities, as opposed to the
	infrastructure, skills, and preferences of individuals participating in a given activity.  Source models map
	the potential recreational quality of a given part of the landscape for a particular activity.  Flow models 
	can be used to connect beneficiaries to areas where recreation occurs.</description>

		<description>
		This model considers the value of views from mountain summits and overlooks for hikers.  View quality and obstructions are
		modeled using a line-of-sight model, which identifies viewshed quality at alternative mountain summits.  A transportation
		model using road networks and recreational preferences will be developed in the future to identify spatial connections between
		people and their preferred recreational sites.

		This model considers protection of public infrastructure as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  Public infrastructure (e.g.,
		transportation, energy, or water infrastructure) can be damaged by floodwater or the use of such infrastructure can be impaired 
		by inudation (e.g., roads being impassable due to flooding).  These models map flows from flood sources (precipitation), sinks (areas
		whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and beneficiary groups and link these
		via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map public infrastructure at risk of flooding, 
		we simply intersect roads, railways, or other infrastructure with data delimiting the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		This model considers protection of human life and housing as a potential beneficiary of flood regulation.  For people living in flood
		zones, floodwater can destroy housing and personal property and pose a risk to human lives.  These models map flows from flood sources 
		(precipitation), sinks (areas whose topography, vegetation, and soils promote detention and infiltration of flood water), and 
		beneficiary groups and link these via a flow model accounting for the downstream movement of floodwater.  To map housing at risk of 
		flooding, we simply housing data (where available) or NLCD developed land with data delimiting the 100 or 500-year floodplain.

		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, this map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas, based on 
		transportation networks, recreational preferences, site quality, and a distance decay 
		function.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to 
		the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics. 
		For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that 
		actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
		where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
		were neutralized by sinks are not shown.
		 
		This map shows the amount of recreational use actually seen at a recreation area 
		when accounting for demand and spatial flows of visitors.

		The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
		locations.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
		but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services, 
		the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.
		
		This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility via transportation 
		networks makes their use level more limited than their attractiveness alone would 
		dictate.

		The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
		carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
		users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.
		
		This map shows users too distant from a recreational resource to benefit from it.
