	<description>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward recreational activities, as opposed to the

	the potential recreational quality of a given part of the landscape for a particular activity.  Flow models

online interface we should hold off on doing so for now.  We also have data & defmodel statements for scenic drives that I 
think should go in the rec models vs. viewsheds - if we do so, need to add the concepts to the right storylines.

		<description>
		This model considers the value of views from mountain summits and overlooks for hikers.  View quality and obstructions are
		modeled using a line-of-sight model, which identifies viewshed quality at alternative mountain summits.  A transportation
		model using road networks and recreational preferences will be developed in the future to identify spatial connections between
		people and their preferred recreational sites.

		This model considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality areas for bird watching.  The 
		source model maps areas that have high bird species diversity, the presence of rare or charismatic species, land that is
		accessible to the public, and areas where surface water is present as having high potential value for bird watching.
		By combining this map with information about recreational travel patterns and site selection, we can map the connections
		between recreational users and specific sites, showing recreational use alongside other ecosystem services provided by 
		recreational areas.

		This model considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality areas for wildlife viewing.  Since 
		wildlife viewing may be enjoyed as a part of numerous different types of outdoor activities, we can show the suitability 
		of areas for wildlife viewing in conjunction with areas suitable for other types of recreational activities (e.g., hiking, 
		camping, hunting, fishing, scenic drives).  The source model maps areas that have high wildlife species diversity, land 
		that is accessible to the public, and areas where surface water is present as having high potential value for wildlife 
		viewing.  By combining this map with information about recreational travel patterns and site selection, we can map the 
		connections between recreational users and specific sites, showing recreational use alongside other ecosystem services

			<p>The presence of ten rare or charismatic bird species identified as important by birding tour guides
			for southeast Arizona.  The ten species included are: elegant trogon (_Trogon elegans_), red-faced warbler 
			(_Cardelina rubrifrons_), sulphur-bellied flycatcher (_Myiodynastes luteiventris_), painted redstart 
			(_Myioborus pictus_), five-striped sparrow (_Aimophila quinquestriata_), Cassin’s sparrow (_Aimophila 
			cassinii_), Botteri’s sparrow (_Aimophila botterii_), vermillion flycatcher (_Pyrocephalus rubinus_), 
			tropical kingbird (_Tyrannus melancholicus_), and yellow-billed cuckoo (_Coccyzus americanus_).</p>
			<h1>Role in models</h1>
			<p>Rare or charismatic bird data are used as an input to the birding source model, which is used to 
			estimate an area's suitability for birding.  Data for public access, the presence of surface water,

			<h1>Role in models</h1>
			<p>Trail data can be used in the recreation flow model to show recreational accessibility for certain parts of 
			a recreation area.  Without dedicated trail access, recreational use may be much lower.  Areas with easily-accessible 
			or high use trails offer a different visitor experience than more remote trails.</p>
			<h1>Representation</h1>
			<p>Data are represented as a presence or absence map showing the location of trails.</p>
			<h1>Source</h1>
			<p>Various public land management agencies.</p>

 <!-- Flow models and maps are not yet active for recreation.  Concepts are described below so that they
 can be included once recreational flow models have been implemented.  The flow concepts below currently 
 including only actual and inaccessible flow concepts, since theoretical concepts are already included as 
 source and use model outputs and there are no sinks for recreation.-->

		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, this map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas, based on 
		transportation networks, recreational preferences, site quality, and a distance decay 
		function.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to 
		the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics. 
		For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that 
		actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
		where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
		were neutralized by sinks are not shown.
		 
		This map shows the amount of recreational use actually seen at a recreation area 
		when accounting for demand and spatial flows of visitors.

		The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
		service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for 
		users located across the landscape.
		
		This map shows the residential location of users who actually travel to sites 
		via “recreation flows” to engage in recreational activities at source areas.

		The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
		locations.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
		but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services, 
		the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.
		
		This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility via transportation 
		networks makes their use level more limited than their attractiveness alone would 
		dictate.

		The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
		carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
		users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.
		
		This map shows users too distant from a recreational resource to benefit from it.
