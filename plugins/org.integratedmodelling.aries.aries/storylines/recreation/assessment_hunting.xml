    <group></group>
    <description>
      This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward
      providing high-quality areas for hunting, specifically for javelina
      (peccary), one of several important game species in southeast
      Arizona. The source model maps areas where javelina habitat is
      present, land that is accessible to the public, and areas where
      surface water is present as having high potential value for javelina
      hunting. By combining this map with information about recreational
      travel patterns and site selection, connections between recreational
      users and specific sites can be mapped, showing recreational use
      alongside other ecosystem services provided by recreational areas.

      *Actual flow maps* show the flow paths that deliver actual
      services to beneficiaries. These are selected from the total flow
      density to only show these flow paths that are not depleted by sinks
      and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable
      benefits to the users and the density is proportional to the value
      accrued. For preventive services, the flow paths show how much of the
      carrier reaches users, delivering actual damage.

      This map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas,
      based on transportation networks, recreational preferences, site
      quality, and a distance decay function.

      *Actual source maps* show sources that actually provide a
      service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics. For provisioning
      services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that actually
      provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
      where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a
      damaging carrier that was neutralized by sinks are not shown.

      This map shows the amount of recreational use actually occurring
      at a recreation area when accounting for demand and spatial flows of
      visitors.

      *Inaccessible source maps* show source areas whose values are
      irrelevant to ecosystem service delivery, because of a lack of flow
      connections between sources and users.

      For provisioning services, this is the portion of the value that
      must be subtracted from the total source map to define a maximum
      potential benefit for the users. For preventive services, it shows
      those areas that have no potential of producing damage because the
      flow dynamics prevent the carrier from impacting any significant user.

      This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility
      via transportation networks makes their use level more limited than
      their attractiveness alone would dictate.

      *Inaccessible use maps* shows potential users that cannot
      receive a service due to a lack of flow routes linking source and user
      locations.

      For provisioning services, this corresponds to value produced by
      the environment that cannot be reached by users. For preventive
      services, it corresponds to damage that could have been inflicted on
      users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.

      This map shows users too distant from a recreational site to
      benefit from it.
