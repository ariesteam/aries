  <runninghead>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward bird watching as a recreational activity.</runninghead>
  <description>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward
  bird watching as a recreational activity, as opposed to the
  infrastructure, skills, and preferences of individuals participating
  in a given activity.  Source models map the potential quality for
  viewing diverse and/or charismatic birds in a given part of the
  landscape.  Flow models can be used to connect beneficiaries to
  areas where birding can occur.</description>

    <description>
      This storyline considers the contribution of ecosystems toward providing high-quality areas for bird watching.  The
      source model maps areas that have high bird species diversity, the presence of rare or charismatic species, land that is
      accessible to the public, and areas where surface water is present as having high potential value for bird watching.
      By combining this map with information about recreational travel patterns and site selection, we can map the connections
      between recreational users and specific sites, showing recreational use alongside other ecosystem services provided by
      recreational areas.

      The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
      humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
      that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
      users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
      the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
      damage.

      In this case, this map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas, based on
      transportation networks, recreational preferences, site quality, and a distance decay
      function.

      The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is relevant to
      the provision of a service after accounting for sinks and flow dynamics.
      For provisioning services, this is the amount and location of a benefit that
      actually provides benefits to the users. For preventive services, it shows
      where the actual damage came from. Source regions that provided a damaging carrier
      were neutralized by sinks are not shown.

      This map shows the amount of recreational use actually seen at a recreation area
      when accounting for demand and spatial flows of visitors.

      The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
      service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for
      users located across the landscape.

      This map shows the residential location of users who actually travel to sites
      via “recreation flows” to engage in recreational activities at source areas.

      The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a
      service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
      locations.

      For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
      but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services,
      the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.

      This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility via transportation
      networks makes their use level more limited than their attractiveness alone would
      dictate.

      The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
      carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
      this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
      users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
      inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.

      This map shows users too distant from a recreational resource to benefit from it.
