	<description>Values resulting from ecosystem contributions toward recreational activities, as opposed to the
	infrastructure, skills, and preferences of individuals participating in a given activity.  Source models map
	the potential recreational quality of a given part of the landscape for a particular activity.  Flow models 
	can be used to connect beneficiaries to areas where recreation occurs.</description>

online interface we should perhaps hold off on doing so for now.  We also have data & defmodel statements for scenic drives that I 
think should go in the rec models vs. viewsheds - if we do so, need to add the concepts to the right storylines. -->

		<description>
		This storyline considers the value of views from mountain summits and overlooks for hikers.  View quality and 
        obstructions are modeled using a line-of-sight model, which identifies viewshed quality at alternative mountain 
        summits.  A transportation model using road networks and recreational preferences will be developed in the future 
        to identify spatial connections between people and their preferred recreational sites.

		The *actual flow density* map shows the flow paths that deliver actual services to
		humans. These are selected from the total flow density to only show these flow paths
		that are not depleted by sinks and actually reach users.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths deliver valuable benefits to the
		users and the density is proportional to the value accrued. For preventive services,
		the flow paths show how much of the carrier reaches users, delivering actual
		damage.
		
		In this case, this map shows the movement of people toward recreation areas, based on 
		transportation networks, recreational preferences, site quality, and a distance decay

		The *actual use map* shows the level of use of a beneficial carrier for a provisioning
		service or damage caused by a detrimental carrier for a preventive service, for 
		users located across the landscape.
		
		This map shows the residential location of users who actually travel to sites 
		via “recreation flows” to engage in recreational activities at source areas.

		<description>
		The *inaccessible source map* shows the flow paths that cannot deliver a 
		service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source and user
		locations.
		
		For provisioning services, these flow paths show areas that could provide a benefit,
		but do not due to a lack of flow connections to potential users.  For preventive services, 
		the flow paths show potential sources of a damaging carrier that do not impact people.
		
		This map shows recreational areas whose current accessibility via transportation 
		networks makes their use level more limited than their attractiveness alone would 
		dictate.

		<description>
		The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
		carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
		users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.
		
		This map shows users too distant from a recreational resource to benefit from it.
