		<description><![CDATA[
		
			<p>This storyline demonstrates the use of ARIES in quantifying
			specific values of an ecosystem service. In this case we concentrate on 
			the value of fish resources to coastal population that depend on fish for sustainance.</p>
			
			<p>Subsistence harvesting of ecosystem goods is critical 
			in the developing world as well as in developed nations. 
			Such ecosystem goods have been termed
			the “GDP of the poor”, since they provide employment and
			livelihoods for many of the world’s poor while not being monetized
			in traditional economic accounts like GDP. Societal dependence on 
			subsistence fisheries, combined with
			overfishing, pollution, and climate change, demands
			sustainable management of aquatic resources. </p>

			<p>Thanks to the support of the 
			<a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank">UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a> 
			we have developed this storyline for
			Madagascar, chosen because of its high rate of poverty, dependence on fisheries
			as a key protein source in rural communities, and prevalent
			deforestation-driven sedimentation and erosion, which
			strongly affect its coastal and marine systems.</p>

		<p>Populations that live in the coastal area in poor countries depend on fish stocks for 
		their daily subsistence. This analysis was therefore restricted to populations living
		close to the coast. In this storyline, we used a coastal buffer of 5km, assuming that
		the likely beneficiaries of subsistence fisheries need to be able to reach the coast walking
		or biking. Distance to the coast was categorized in three classes of distance, and this
		variable entered the probabilistic calculation of the benefitshed.</p>

			<h1>Benefitshed map</h1>
			<p>This map depicts our <b>benefitshed</b>, the result of the probabilistic modelling of the need for fish to support the livelihoods of coastal
			populations. Darker blues indicate a need that is higher in poorer populations that live closer to the coast. The map you are seeing is a 
			probabilistic one, illustrating the probability of needing fish for subsistence. You can click on the map and visualize the
			probability distribution in each point. The flow model you will see later determines the actual value of the
			fish resource, depending on the need, the quality and abundance of the resource, and the ability of accessing
			it by walking to the shoreline.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[
		<h1>Provisionshed map</h1>
		<p>The source of benefits for this storyline is the total amount of potential fish 
		harvestable by coastal populations. Only a small fraction of this potential is usable
		by the beneficiaries; the computation of the actually used potential is shown later in
		the flow model output.</p>
		<p>Historical catch data are published by the FAO (2008).  These data do not explicitly 
		describe subsistence catch and do not contain catch records specific to any of the species 
		for which we have relative abundance data. Despite these limitations, we can use assumptions 
		to estimate the likely supply or source value for each species.  These assumptions can be adjusted 
		should more refined fisheries information become available. This map shows estimated source
		values for the mangrove red snapper (<em>Lutjanus argentimaculatus</em>). A similar process was
		used to estimate source values for the other species considered. The sum of these maps constitutes
		our <b>source model</b>.</p>  
		
		<p>Historical catch data from The Sea Around Us Project shows that 71.6% of the total 
		catch for Madagascar from 1950-2004 is “non-identified marine pelagic fishes.”  
		In 2005, Madagascar produced 138,477 tonnes of fish from capture fisheries, of which 
		77,636 tonnes were for commodity trade and production.  Another 72,300 tonnes were 
		taken by traditional fishermen; however, this catch is not necessarily mutually 
		exclusive of the commodity sector.  Subtracting the commodity catch from the 
		total catch leaves 60,841 tonnes of fish which we assume goes toward 
		local consumption.  Assuming 71.6% of the locally consumed fish are 
		“non-identified marine pelagic fishes,” these account for 43,562 tonnes.
		Assuming that each of the fish species for which 
		we have distribution data accounted for 20% of that total,
		this would give 8,712 tonnes of fish caught for each of these species.  
		We then divide the total catch for each species according to their 
		relative abundance along the Madagascar coast in order to produce a map
		of subsistence fish production for each species under the above assumptions (Equation 1).  
		A similar equation holds for subsistence fisheries use (Equation 2).</p>
		
		<quote>(1)  S = a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3 + … + anSn</quote><br/>
		<quote>(2)  D = a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3 + … + anSn</quote>  

		<p>Where</p>
		
		<dl>
			 <dt>S</dt>  <dd>the total source or supply of subsistence fisheries (kg)</dd>
	  		 <dt>D</dt>  <dd>the total demand for subsistence fisheries (kg)</dd>
		   	 <dt>an</dt> <dd>the percentage of the total demand met with species n</dd>
			 <dt>Sn</dt> <dd>the total mass of species n caught (kg)</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>We make a series of simplifying assumptions based on limited data regarding 
		the magnitude of supply and demand in Madagascar’s subsistence fishery and the 
		distribution of valuable species.  Given better data and/or expert knowledge of 
		the relative use of different species, ARIES can adjust the model coefficients 
		to more accurately quantify human dependence on Madagascar’s fisheries.</p>

			<p>We have computed both the amount of need (benefitshed) and the amount of potential
			provision (provisionshed) of fish. The last step of the analysis is modelling the
			flow of this ecosystem service to the beneficiaries we have identified, which allows us
			to understand the actual value of this resource in this context, as well as pointing 
			out areas of unmet need and inefficiencies in the use of the resource.</p>
			
			<p>The subsistence fisheries flow model shows the expected spatial dependence of 
			specific fisheries users on particular fisheries areas. Users are assumed to move from a 
			point of origin (their homes) to an oceanic fishery, harvest fish, and return 
			to their homes, where fish are consumed, via road or path networks.</p>  
			
			<p>This map shows the paths and road network that determines the accessibility 
			of the locations where fish are provided. The flow model moves a given quantity 
			of fish (in kg) from the ocean to areas of demand along these roads or paths.  
			Each coastal ocean point has an estimated potential source of fish, computed as
			our provisionshed model.  Each point on land has an estimated potential use for oceanic 
			fish, computed in our benefitshed model.</p>

			<p>We assume that the use of oceanic subsistence fisheries is greatest close to 
			the coast and declines relatively quickly moving inland.  We model this distance 
			decay as a Gaussian curve with high subsistence use within 1 km of the coast, 
			steep decline at distances of 2-3 km of the coast, and slowly declining 
			subsistence use out to a distance of 5 km of the coast.</p>

		<p>The portion of demand for fish not satisfied due to inadequate size of the 
		   fishery or a lack of proximity to a fishery.  If this is zero, some unutilized 
		   fish may be a result of a true surplus and not just a lack of proximity.  
		   If this is greater than zero, there is no surplus within range.</p>
