			<p>Fisheries resources play multiple roles in the world's economies and
			societies. Fish are collected for subsistence, recreational, ceremonial, and commercial
			purposes. The annual global value of fish resources was estimated at
			$52 billion USD, when considering only the market value of fish harvested in 1997.</p>

			<p>At the same time, many fish stocks around the globe are in decline due
			to overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution. 
			Improving fisheries management requires an improved understanding of use of and impacts to
            fisheries resources and the monetary and non-monetary 
			values connected to these resources.</p>

			<p>This module includes all the fisheries-related storylines that have been
			developed in ARIES and can be applied to the user-defined region of interest. 
			As new models are added to ARIES, new storylines will appear and more options will be given
			for scenario analysis.</p>
