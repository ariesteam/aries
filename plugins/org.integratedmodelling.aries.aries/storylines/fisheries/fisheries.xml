			<p>Fish resources play multiple roles in the world's economies and
			societies. Fish are collected for subsistence, recreational, and commercial
			purposes. The global value of fish resources per year was estimated at
			52 billion USD considering only the traded fish in 1997.</p>

			<p>At the same time, fish stocks around the globe are in great danger due
			to overfishing and the habitat destruction due to climate change and pollution. 
			This state of affairs demands better understanding of the way people use fish 
			resources and of the actual (monetary and non-monetary) values connected to 
			these resources, to allow for sustainable planning of their use.</p>

			<p>This module collects all the fisheries-related storylines that have been
			defined in ARIES and can be	applied to the region of interest you have identified. 
			As new models are added to ARIES, new storylines will appear and more options will be given
			for scenario analysis.</p>
