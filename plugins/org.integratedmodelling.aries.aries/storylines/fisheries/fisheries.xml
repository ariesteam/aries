    <description><![CDATA[
    <p>Fisheries resources play multiple roles in the world's
    economies and societies. Fish are collected for subsistence,
    recreational, ceremonial, and commercial purposes. The annual global
    value of fish resources was estimated at $52 billion USD, when
    considering only the market value of fish harvested in 1997.</p>

    <p>At the same time, many fish stocks around the globe are in
    decline due to overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change, and
    pollution. Improving fisheries management requires an improved
    understanding of use of and impacts to fisheries resources and the
    monetary and non-monetary values connected to these resources.</p>
    
    <p>This module includes all the fisheries-related storylines that
    have been developed in ARIES and can be applied to the user-defined
    region of interest. As new models are added to ARIES, new storylines
    will appear and more options will be given for scenario analysis.</p>
