		<description>
			This storyline demonstrates the use of ARIES in quantifying
			specific values of fisheries resources to coastal populations 
			that depend on these resources as critical sources of nutrition
			and protein.
			
			Subsistence harvesting of ecosystem goods is critical 
			in the developing world as well as in developed nations. 
			Such ecosystem goods have been termed the "GDP of the poor," 
			since they provide employment and livelihoods for many of the 
			world’s poor while not being monetized in traditional economic 
			accounts like GDP. Societal dependence on subsistence fisheries, 
			combined with overfishing, pollution, and climate change, adds to
			the importance of sustainably managing aquatic resources.

			With the support of the 
			"UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre":http://www.unep-wcmc.org
			we have developed this storyline for Madagascar, chosen 
			because of its high rate of poverty, dependence on fisheries
			as a key protein source in rural communities, and prevalent
			deforestation-driven sedimentation and erosion, which
			impact its coastal and marine systems.

		Populations that live in coastal areas in developing nations often depend on local fisheries for 
		their daily subsistence. This analysis was therefore restricted to populations living
		near the coast. In this storyline, we used a coastal buffer of 5km, assuming that the 
		likely beneficiaries of subsistence fisheries need to be able to reach the coast by walking. 
		Distance to the coast was categorized in three classes of distance, and this variable entered 
		the probabilistic calculation to identify actual use of subsistence fisheries.

			This map shows the result of a probabilistic models estimating the need for fish to support the 
			livelihoods of coastal populations. Darker blues indicate greater need - among poorer populations that live 
			closer to the coast. This map is a probabilistic one, illustrating the probability of needing fish 
			for subsistence. You can click on the map and visualize the probability distribution in each point. The flow model 
			you will see later determines the actual value of the fish resource, depending on the need, the quality and abundance 
			of the resource, and the ability to access it by walking to the shoreline.

		<h1>Subsistence fisheries provision map</h1>
		<p>The source of benefits for this storyline is the total amount of potential fish 
		harvestable by coastal populations. Only a small fraction of this potential is usable
		by the beneficiaries; the computation of the actual use is shown later in
		the flow model output.</p>
		
		<p>Historical catch data are published by the FAO (2008).  These data do not explicitly 
		describe subsistence catch and do not contain catch records specific to any of the species 
		for which we have relative abundance data. Despite these limitations, we can use assumptions 
		to estimate the likely supply or source value for the three species of interest.  These 
		assumptions can be adjusted should more refined fisheries information become available. 
		This map shows estimated source values for the mangrove red snapper 
		(<em>Lutjanus argentimaculatus</em>). A similar process was used to estimate source values 
		for the other species considered. The sum of these maps constitutes our <b>source model</b>.</p>  
		
		<p>Historical catch data from The Sea Around Us Project shows that 71.6% of the total 
		catch for Madagascar from 1950-2004 is "non-identified marine pelagic fishes."  
		In 2005, Madagascar produced 138,477 tonnes of fish from capture fisheries, of which 
		77,636 tonnes were for commodity trade and production.  Another 72,300 tonnes were 
		taken by traditional fishermen; however, this catch is not necessarily mutually 
		exclusive of the commodity sector.  Subtracting the commodity catch from the 
		total catch leaves 60,841 tonnes of fish which we assume goes toward 
		local consumption.  Assuming 71.6% of the locally consumed fish are 
		"non-identified marine pelagic fishes," these account for 43,562 tonnes.
		Assuming that each of the fish species for which we have distribution data 
		accounted for 20% of that total, this would give 8,712 tonnes of fish caught 
		for each of these species.  We then divide the total catch for each species according 
		to their relative abundance along the Madagascar coast in order to produce a map
		of subsistence fish production for each species under the above assumptions (Equation 1).  
		A similar equation holds for subsistence fisheries use (Equation 2).</p>
		
		<quote>(1)  S = a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3 + … + anSn</quote><br/>
		<quote>(2)  D = a1S1 + a2S2 + a3S3 + … + anSn</quote>  

		<p>Where</p>
		
		<dl>
			 <dt>S</dt>  <dd>the total source or supply of subsistence fisheries (kg)</dd>
	  		 <dt>D</dt>  <dd>the total demand for subsistence fisheries (kg)</dd>
		   	 <dt>an</dt> <dd>the percentage of the total demand met with species n</dd>
			 <dt>Sn</dt> <dd>the total mass of species n caught (kg)</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>These simplifying assumptions reflect limited data for supply and demand in 
		Madagascar’s subsistence fishery and the distribution of valuable species.  
		Given better data and/or expert knowledge of the relative use of different species, 
		we can easily adjust the model coefficients to more accurately quantify human 
		dependence on local subsistence fisheries in Madagascar or elsewhere.</p>

			We have computed both the amount of need (demand) and the amount of potential
			provision (supply) of fish. The last step of the analysis is to model the
			flow of this ecosystem service to the beneficiaries we have identified, which allows us
			to understand the actual value of this resource used in this context, as well as pointing 
			out areas of unmet demand and inefficiencies in the use of the resource.
			
			The subsistence fisheries flow model shows the expected spatial dependence of 
			specific fisheries users on particular fisheries areas. Users are assumed to move from a 
			point of origin (their homes) to an oceanic fishery, harvest fish, and return 
			to their homes, where fish are consumed, via road or path networks.  
			
			This map shows the paths and road network that determines the accessibility 
			of the locations where fish are provided. The flow model moves a given quantity 
			of fish (in kg) from the ocean to areas of demand along these roads or paths.  
			Each coastal ocean point has an estimated potential source of fish, computed in the
			source or supply model.  Each point on land has an estimated potential use for oceanic 
			fish, computed in our demand model.

			We assume that the use of oceanic subsistence fisheries is greatest close to 
			the coast and declines relatively quickly moving inland.  We model this distance 
			decay as a Gaussian curve with high subsistence use within 1 km of the coast, 
			steep decline at distances of 2-3 km of the coast, and slowly declining 
			subsistence use out to a distance of 5 km of the coast.

		The *actual source map* shows the portion of the source map that is actually
		relevant to the provision of a service after accounting for flow dynamics. 
		This map shows the part of the source or supply region that is actually 
		providing benefits to the users.
		
		In this model, the actual use map is the quantity of fish harvested for 
		subsistence use.

		The *actual use map* represents the portion of the demand map or potential users  whose needs 
		have been satisfied by the flow of services, taking into account the availability of the resource,
		and flow dynamics.

		In this model, the map shows the portion of demand for fish satisfied by flows of fish to people 
		from a fishery.

		The *inaccessible source map* shows the part of the source value that cannot 
		deliver a service carrier to humans based on the flow routes and the source 
		and user locations.
			
		In this case, the map showes fisheries that are not used due to lack of proximity 
		or pathways to users.  This value may also be positive if some of the fish supply 
		remains after all user demand is satiatied.

		The *inaccessible use map* shows the potential users that cannot receive a service
		carrier due to flow routes and the source and user locations. For provisioning services,
		this corresponds to value produced by the environment but that cannot be reached by
		users. For preventive services, it corresponds to damage that could have been
		inflicted on users but is not due to a lack of flow connections to users.
		
		This map shows the portion of demand for fish not satisfied due to inadequate size of the 
		fishery or a lack of proximity to a fishery.  If this is zero, some unutilized 
		fish may be a result of a true surplus and not just a lack of proximity.  
		If this is greater than zero, there is no surplus within range.
