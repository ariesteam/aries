		<description title="Navigating an ARIES case study"><![CDATA[
		With growing interest in using ecosystem services for decision making, 
		demand has grown for systematic methods and tools to quantify ecosystem 
		service values. ARIES maps the potential provision of ecosystem services 
		(sources), their users (use), and biophysical features that can deplete
		 service flows (sinks) using ecological process models or Bayesian models.
		 ARIES then uses a series of agent-based flow algorithms to map actual 
		 service flow from ecosystems to people.
